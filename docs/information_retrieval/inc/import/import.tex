As input data I used the given DamenBlusen.txt-file.
Unfortunatelu I had some trouble importing it.\\
The structure of the different lines in the file is inconsistent.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Some words (which will later be used as term to describe a product) are merely synonym to for others (such as: 'whisper white' and 'white', 'eggnog' and 'beige')
    \item Or even worse are translations of the same attribute (such as 'white' and 'wei\"zs')
    \item Switches between 'in Gr\"o\"sen' and 'bei Gr\"o\"sen'
\end{itemize}
Currently there are three items with a price, which can not be imported.\\
Items without a price are being ignored!
