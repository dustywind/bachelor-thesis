Currently the apparel industry is not one of the healthiest sectors in the industry.
That's due to conflicts in Middle East and Ukraine, as well as problems within the European Union.\citep[p. 4]{alten:14}\\
The lack of growth within the clothing industry and even a decline in sales, however, do not mean that the diversity and quantity of products on the market became easier to handle for the customer.
In the end, consumer still has a wide variety of products from which he can choose.
And anywhere, where the count of choices one can take is to high to grasp, it comes in handy to have something helps making decisions.\\
One of these tools are so called recommendation systems. The concept of those will be explained in detail later.


\subsection{Choice overload}
Due to the nearly unlimited number of choices one can make regarding the variety of products, many customers have trouble finding the products they like best.
This problem is commonly known as "choice overload".\citep[p. 454]{stanton:12}
One domain where this problem has been noticed is the clothing industry.
There are many possible reasons why customer struggle with decision-making\citep[p. 454]{stanton:12} - however, for this project the scope is limited to possible approaches to solve the problem.
