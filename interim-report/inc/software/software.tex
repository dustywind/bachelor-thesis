\section{Software}
Software is much more than pure source-code.
To every program we expect a proper documentation as well a "tidied up" source-code which can be maintained easily.
For this reason the process of software-development has to be planned in-depth accurately be documented.


\subsection{Proceeding}
At the end of the project there will be two software-components.\\
First, a recommender-library that is capable of handling product-data and generating recommendation.
Second, a online-shop that presents products and provides recommendations for products the user might like, based on the recommender-library.
As programming language for implementing the recommender-library Python has been chosen.
A MVC-Framework called Django will be used to set up the online-shop.

\subsection{Documentation}
The theory of the code will be explained in a separate document with many examples to visualize the way the recommendation system works.
Additionally there will be a documentation based on python-sphinx which will be automatically generated out of source-code comments.


\subsection{Milestones}
The development of the recommender algorithm will be subdivided into stages.
These can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:softwaremilestones}.
Each of the steps has to be finished before the next can start.\\
