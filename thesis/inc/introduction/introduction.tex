When a typical customer enters a shop or department store, he often gets confronted with a very large amount of products he can choose from.
This is especially true, when searching for products on the internet in a web shop.
The commonly known web shop amazon.com for instance offers about 280 million different products on their internet presence for the United States.\citep{marketplaceanalytics:2014}
Even shops dedicated to only a special kind of product have a wide array of products.
On Zalando, a German online shop dedicated to clothing, one can choose out of 150.000 products and 1.500 different brands.\citep{visser:2014}\\
There is a general belief that great choice pleases the customers needs.
However it is actually proven, that this idea is not fully correct and reality is much more complex.
Already in 2000 a group of scientists demonstrated, that a great variety can also have negative effects.\citep[312]{diehl:2010}
It is proven, that large assortments can lower the customers willingness to purchase products.\citep[313]{diehl:2010}
Furthermore to much choice can also lower the customers satisfaction.\citep[320]{diehl:2010}


Since especially online-shops have a overwhelming assortment of products, they struggle most with the problem of overloading their potential customers with products.
Therefore many online shops have already implemented recommendation systems to aid their customers by finding the right product.
Recommender systems help users finding relevant items they like, by guiding him to those items in a huge space of products.\citep[p.~63]{bollen:2010}


There are different possible approaches to recommendation systems and some of them will be discussed in the later sections (section~\ref{sec:recommenderapproaches}) of this thesis.
This thesis focuses on implementing a recommender system, all necessary steps towards it and the evaluation of its aptitude.
As algorithm for the recommender engine Rocchio's algorithm will be implemented.
Also there will be some alternative ways of input data collection regarding the users preferences.
