When a typical customer enters a shop or department store, he often gets confronted with a very large amount of products he can choose from.
This is especially true, when searching for products online in a web shop.
The commonly known web shop amazon.com for instance offers about 280 million different products on their internet presence for the United States.\citep{marketplaceanalytics:14}
Even shops dedicated to only a special kind of product have a wide array of products.
On Zalando, a German online shop dedicated to clothing, one can choose out of 150.000 products of 1.500 different brands.\citep{visser:14}\\
The general belief that great choice pleases needs.
However it is actually proven, that this idea is not correct.
Already in 2000 a group of scientists demonstrated, that a great variety can also have negative effects.\citep[312]{diehl:2010}
